<p>I’m CKB, a student from Taiwan. Soon I will major in CSIE in uni, so I made this blog, to hopefully aid and record my learning, 
while learning some basic web design as well.</p>

<h2 id="if-youre-from-taiwan-why-are-you-writing-in-english">If you’re from Taiwan, why are you writing in English?</h2>
<p>I do know my English is not very fluent, but since it’s easier to switch between code and article if I write in English, I might as well just compromise.</p>
